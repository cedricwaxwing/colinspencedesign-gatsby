              Every.org looks like a fantastic initiative that I would absolutely love to be a part of! Over the last 4 or 5 years, Iâ€™ve found that at many times, the worldâ€™s problems are just so daunting and the prospect of solving them all just becomes entirely overwhelming. The main way that Iâ€™ve combatted this feeling in the past has been to focus on one or two initiatives that I care strongly about (Universal Basic Income, Education). And while that has led to some incredible, unregrettable paths, I canâ€™t help but feel like there is still so much out there left to do.

              From a product perspective, I just love the fact that I can easily find charities and organizations that are aligned to my interests on Every.org. From a product designer perspective, I love the idea that I could use my skills, and focus my time and energy into building something that makes it easy for other people to do the same. Iâ€™m thrilled at this opportunity, and I hope youâ€™ll enjoy looking through my portfolio. Thank you for your consideration.
