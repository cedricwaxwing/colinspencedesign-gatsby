      Granify is a SaaS solution that fits smack dab at the intersection of
      artificial intelligence and e-commerce. It enables online retailers to
      maximize their sales by using cutting edge big data and machine learning
      technologies. The software predicts specific user barriers, and offers
      solutions to those problems before the user leaves the site.

              This resulted in significant operational inefficiencies and the

            I was committed to finding a solution that would benefit both

            results for the company financially. I worked as a liaison and
            mediator between the designers and the CEO to remedy the issue. I
            initiated a discussion with the CEO to discuss the problem from my
            team's perspective. I outlined how the current approval process was
            having a negative effect on performance and employee engagement. I
            came prepared with a detailed, alternate plan that ensured he would

            The alternative plan consisted of 3 groups within the design team,
            each group representing a particular sub-process within our concept
            development operation. These consisted of
            {` `}
            <strong>User Experience Research, Problem Solving,</strong> and
            {` `}
            <strong>Visual Design.</strong>I had already gauged interest from
            the design team in their 1:1s, and had proposed which designers I
            felt would excel in each particular group, based on their strengths
            and career trajectory. The designers would function as a contributor
            when they work on a project, and ultimately push their concept
            through the three stages, but I wanted them to be actively involved
            in refining the process.

            mandatory revisions and approvals, and placed all final decisions in

            justify their design decisions. This was a very powerful change,

            each group, they were able to quickly address pain points and
            implement new or different procedures to accommodate. I invited the
            CEO to the retrospectives, so that he could offer insight from his
            perspective, and ultimately ensure that the groups were aligned with
            his vision.

            We also noticed a significant increase in the designerâ€™s engagement
            and overall happiness. The system also helped us innovate new
            concepts and completely redefine old, "proven" concepts. The process
            as a whole had a tremendous impact on the company, and the results
            had exceeded both the CEOâ€™s and my own expectations.
